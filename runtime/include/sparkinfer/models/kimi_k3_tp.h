// Kimi K3 decode across N GPUs with TENSOR parallelism.
//
// Distinct from the layer-split pipeline in kimi_k3.h, and not a replacement for it
// in every case — they trade different things:
//
//   pipeline   Each GPU owns a contiguous LAYER RANGE. No collectives, one small
//              handoff per stage boundary. But only one GPU is busy at a time, so
//              token latency is the SUM of the stages: it buys capacity, not speed.
//
//   this       Every GPU participates in every layer. The routed experts are banded
//              across ranks, so the 70%-of-runtime MoE dispatch is divided by
//              tp_size, at the cost of one all-reduce per MoE layer.
//
// SCOPE: ShardPolicy::ExpertsOnly. The 896 routed experts (531 of UD-IQ1_S's 553 GiB)
// are banded; everything else is replicated. Consequences, all deliberate:
//
//   - The MoE dispatch is the ONLY sharded op, so there is exactly ONE collective per
//     MoE layer — 92 per token, not the 186 a fully-sharded K3 would need. It lands
//     at expert_latent (3584), before ffn_routed_norm, because rms_norm is not linear
//     and cannot be applied to a partial sum. See kimi_k3_decode_plan.cpp.
//   - Attention runs REDUNDANTLY on every rank. That is 8x wasted attention FLOPs and
//     it is the honest cost of not yet threading per-rank head counts through the KDA
//     and MLA kernels. Given the measured split (ffn_moe 69.7%, attention 26.8%), the
//     ceiling here is ~2.6x rather than ~8x — real, but not the end state.
//   - Every rank therefore holds an IDENTICAL hidden state at every layer boundary,
//     which is what lets rank 0's logits be the answer with no gather.
//
// The collective is f32, not bf16: K3's residual stream is f32 by design and reducing
// it in bf16 would truncate to ~8 mantissa bits 92 times per token. make_collective is
// called with need_f32=true, which downgrades a bf16-only fast backend to NCCL up
// front rather than failing after a twenty-minute weight load.

// K3IssuePool — one host thread per rank, so submission is not serial
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MEASURED, at the scored 128k context, before this existed:
//
//     total 109.7 ms/token | host issue 88.4 (80.6%) | collective 5.9 | sync 14.9
//     2232 phase calls/token, 1496 cudaSetDevice/token
//
// 80% of a decode token was ONE host thread asking eight GPUs to do things. The
// GPU is starved, not saturated: when submission finally stops there are only
// ~15 ms of work left to drain. Two consequences follow, and the second is the
// one that matters.
//
//   1. Kernel-level optimisation is nearly invisible here. Making a kernel
//      faster shortens something that was already hidden behind submission.
//
//   2. The rank skew at the collective is MANUFACTURED BY ISSUE ORDER. Rank 0's
//      layer is submitted ~200 launches before rank 7's, so rank 7 arrives late
//      at all 92 barriers, every token, by construction. That is not expert
//      imbalance and no collective backend can fix it — the ranks genuinely
//      were not asked at the same time.
//
// The eight ranks are independent between collectives, so they can be submitted
// concurrently. Each worker owns exactly one device and calls cudaSetDevice ONCE
// at thread start rather than 1496 times per token: the current device is
// thread-local state, which is precisely what makes this both cheap and safe.
//
// THREAD SAFETY, and why this is sound rather than lucky. Every mutable static
// on the forward path (g_mla_part_*, the IQ1_S/IQ2_XS lattice `ready` flags, the
// MLA split cache) is indexed by cudaGetDevice(). Distinct workers own distinct
// devices, so no two threads ever address the same slot. The per-device state
// convention the kernels already follow is what makes per-rank threading safe;
// a shared cache would have to be locked instead.
//
// Spin, not condvar: 186 releases per token against ~240 idle cores. A condvar
// round trip is 10-20 us and would cost ~3 ms/token, eating a third of what
// parallel submission buys. The spin yields after a bounded number of pauses so
// an oversubscribed box degrades instead of livelocking.
